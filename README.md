# **Eat.Sleep.Data Individual Self-Assessment**

## ***Self Assessment***

The Eat.Sleep.Data team consists of 6 members from various backgrounds. The role that I have played at the beginning is to solicit classmates in forming the final project team. Once the final team is formed, the first assignment was the select a topic of interest for the final project. This was done via a shared excel spreadsheet requesting each team member to suggest topic of interest. Each member was asked to select their top 3 topics for the final project and the topic with the most weighted score was selected. We even voted on the team name out of 9 different suggestions! This was how the Airbnb Eat.Sleep.Data team was borned. 

Getting into the project phase, the role that I have played mainly in Circle and X role, and partially triangle. I have setup the database needed to host all the data for this project as well as utilizing Mapbox API to build the map. I have also participated in data cleaning as well as running machine learning model. I have participated in all of the team meetings on discussing data cleaning and machine learning execution. The greatest challenge over the course of the project is keeping up with all the over achieving team member. I have to say this is the best team I have ever had in a university team project. All of the members were very professional and eager to contribute to the success of the project. 

## ***Team Assessment***

The team has utilized Zoom video conferencing, Discord chat program, and Trello as communication tools. The greatest challange of Zoom meeting is to schedule a time that is convenient to each other. However, all team members have do whatever it takes mentallity and have sacrificed personal time to discuss the project status and requirements. There have been lots of disagreement on how to move the project forward but all team members were very respectful and professional in handling conflicts. In the end, I think treating team member with respect is the most important aspect of ensuring the success of the final project.
